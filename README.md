# Carbon Credit Simulation 

## What are carbon credits?
They can be defined as a permit which allows a country or organization to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions and which can be traded if the full allowance is not used.

# The simulation
* Each ball represents a unit of carbon emissions in the atmosphere
* Carbon emissions are produced by the factory by a random time interval
* If a ball comes in contact with the renewable energy source (lower right corner), it is removed from the atmosphere and "netted"
* Overall emissions are displayed in the table, and D3 timegraph

# How to run
* Clone the repository
* Open the index.html file in your browser

# How to use
* Load the file in your browser
* Press "h" key to hide/unhide the renewable energy source

# Conclusions
* The simulation shows that by investing in renewable energy sources, we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions in the atmosphere
